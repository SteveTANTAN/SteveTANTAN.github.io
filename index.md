## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Data and Knowledge Research Group (DKRG)](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dkr/) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). I am under the joint supervision of [Dr. Xiaoyang Wang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~xiaoyangw/) and [Prof. Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/) from UNSW, as well as Dr. [Qing Liu](https://research.csiro.au/ss/people/students/), Dr. [Xiwei Xu](https://research.csiro.au/ss/people/students/), Dr. [Xin Yuan](https://research.csiro.au/ss/people/students/), and Prof. [Liming Zhu](https://research.csiro.au/ss/people/students/) from CSIRO's Software Systems Group, Data61. My research interests include **Graph Mining**, **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**, and **Large Language Models**.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science and my Master of Philosophy (MPhil) at UNSW, where I was also supervised by Dr. Xiaoyang Wang and Prof. Wenjie Zhang.

## Research Interests

* **Graph Mining:** subgraph detection, fairness-aware mining, graph analytics
* **Knowledge Graph Reasoning:** multi-hop reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation
* **Large Language Models:** knowledge-enhanced reasoning, interpretability, cross-source verification
