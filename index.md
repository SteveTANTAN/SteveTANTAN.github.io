## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Data and Knowledge Research Group (DKR)](https://unswdb.github.io/) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of New South Wales (UNSW)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) and [Software Systems Group](https://research.csiro.au/ss/), Data61, CSIRO. I am under the joint supervision of [Dr. Xiaoyang Wang](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/xiaoyang-wang) and [Prof. Wenjie Zhang](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/) from UNSW, as well as [Dr. Qing Liu](https://people.csiro.au/L/Q/Q-Liu), [Dr. Xiwei Xu](https://people.csiro.au/X/S/Xiwei-Xu), [Dr. Xin Yuan](https://people.csiro.au/y/x/xin-yuan), and [Prof. Liming Zhu](https://people.csiro.au/Z/L/Liming-Zhu) from CSIRO's Data61. My research interests include **Graph Mining**, **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**, and **Large Language Models**.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science and my Master of Philosophy (MPhil) at UNSW, where I was also supervised by Dr. Xiaoyang Wang and Prof. Wenjie Zhang.

## Research Interests

- **Graph Mining:** subgraph detection, fairness-aware mining, graph analytics
- **Knowledge Graph Reasoning:** multi-hop reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation
- **Large Language Models:** knowledge-enhanced reasoning, interpretability, cross-source verification
